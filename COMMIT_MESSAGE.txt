fix(dartwing_core): Resolve P1-Critical issues per MASTER_REVIEW.md

This commit addresses all 8 P1-Critical blockers identified in the
comprehensive code review (MASTER_REVIEW.md) for the Basic Test Suite
feature branch (010-basic-test-suite).

ARCHITECTURAL ALIGNMENT FIXES:

✅ P1-007: Remove "Club" from ORG_TYPE_MAP
- Removed "Club" as root organization type (belongs under Association)
- Aligns with PRD Section 3.4: Association covers clubs via subtype

✅ P1-003: Implement fetch_from for Company synced fields
- Added fetch_from="organization.org_name" to company_name field
- Added fetch_from="organization.status" to status field
- Removed Company from ORG_FIELD_MAP (no longer needs manual sync)
- Prevents data drift, enforces Single Source of Truth (constitution.md)

✅ P1-001: Fix test helper to use Organization-first creation flow
- Rewrote _create_test_organization() in test_full_workflow.py
- Changed from concrete-first to Organization-first flow
- Now matches production behavior per dartwing_core_arch.md Section 3.2
- Tests bidirectional linking hooks critical to data integrity

✅ P1-004: Remove OrganizationMixin tests (Feature 8 scope creep)
- Deleted test_organization_mixin.py (327 lines)
- Feature 8 should be separate branch per dartwing_core_features_priority.md
- Prevents false test coverage for unimplemented features

✅ P1-005: Change test users to Dartwing User role
- Changed from System Manager to Dartwing User in test_full_workflow.py
- System Manager bypassed all permission checks, defeating test purpose
- Now properly validates User Permission enforcement (Feature 5)

✅ P1-008: Refactor test cleanup to surface bugs
- Rewrote _cleanup_test_data() in test_permission_api.py
- Cleanup in reverse dependency order (prevents LinkExistsError cascades)
- Selective exception handling (logs real bugs instead of swallowing them)
- Prevents test flakiness per SC-005 requirement

✅ P1-002: Verified hooks.py (NO issues found - already clean)
✅ P1-006: Verified organization.py structure (NO issues found - valid)

ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE:
✓ dartwing_core_arch.md Section 3.2 (Organization-first lifecycle)
✓ dartwing_core_arch.md Section 8.2.2 (Role hierarchy)
✓ dartwing_core_prd.md Section 3.4 (Organization types)
✓ constitution.md Section 1 (Single Source of Truth)
✓ constitution.md Section 5 (Role-based access control)
✓ dartwing_core_features_priority.md (Feature sequencing)

NEXT STEPS:
- Run full test suite: bench --site <site> run-tests --app dartwing
- Verify zero flakiness (run 3 times)
- Test Organization creation flow manually
- Verify Company field sync from Organization
- Address P2-Medium issues in follow-up commits
