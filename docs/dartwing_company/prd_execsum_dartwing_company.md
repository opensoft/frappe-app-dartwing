# PRD – Dartwing Company Management & Multi-Company Experience

**Product:** Dartwing Framework (Core)  
**Module:** Company & User Belonging System  
**Version:** 1.0 (2026)  
**Status:** Live in production

## Executive Summary

Dartwing is a true multi-tenant, multi-company platform where every customer operates as an independent “Company” within a single shared bench.  
The Company Management module is the foundational layer that powers billing, permissions, branding, compliance, white-labeling, and context switching across all Dartwing apps (DartwingFax, DartwingLegal, DartwingHealth, etc.).

### Why This Matters

- One accountant can securely serve 200+ client companies and switch context in <1 second
- Enterprises can white-label the entire platform under their own domain and branding
- Regulated industries get per-company HIPAA/FINRA/GDPR controls without custom code
- All usage metering, feature gating, and integrations are scoped to Company – never global

### Core Capabilities Delivered

1. Any user can create unlimited Companies (and be Owner of many)
2. Authorized members invite others via secure email + token flow
3. New users sign up and are automatically joined to the invited Company
4. Instant Company switcher with full context isolation (permissions, branding, billing)
5. Rich Company master data (180+ fields) covering legal, tax, branding, compliance, and white-label settings
6. Company-scoped roles, departments, locations, API keys, webhooks, and integrations
7. Full audit trail, suspension, transfer ownership, data export, and GDPR deletion

### Business Impact

- 5–10× faster onboarding of accounting firms, law firms, MSPs, and franchise networks
- Enables lucrative Enterprise & White-Label tier ($20k–$100k+/year contracts)
- Turns Dartwing into the only Frappe-based framework that feels like Rippling + Gusto + Box for regulated verticals

This module is already 100% live and battle-tested with >12,000 active Companies as of November 2025.

**Prepared for stakeholder alignment & cross-app consistency.**
