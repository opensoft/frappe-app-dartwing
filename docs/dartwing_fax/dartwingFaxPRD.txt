This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the features for a comprehensive digital fax application, integrating advanced security, AI-driven automation, and a robust document annotation toolkit.
The primary goal is to transform the digital fax service from a simple machine replacement into an automated workflow and communications engine while mitigating security threats like spoofing,,.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Objectives
1. Workflow Automation: Automate the classification and routing of incoming faxes with high accuracy, minimizing manual sorting.
2. Document Management: Provide users with intuitive in-app tools to instantly annotate, sign, and stamp received faxes, enabling them to return the modified document via email or fax with zero friction.
3. Security & Compliance (Inbound): Maximize security and routing efficiency by systematically validating the sender of every incoming fax using a three-tier system, minimizing spam and malicious traffic.
4. Security & Compliance (Outbound): Implement strong authentication layers, including a Confirmation Loop for Email-to-Fax, to prevent unauthorized transmission and customer spoofing,.

2. Module A: AI-Powered Intelligent Fax Routing
This module governs how the system processes and routes incoming documents based on content analysis and predefined rules.
A.1 AI-Driven Content Requirements
Component
Function
Routing Output / Action
OCR/ICR
Converts the fax image (including poor quality or handwritten text) into machine-readable, searchable text.
Provides raw text content.
NLP (Classification)
Analyzes the text content for themes, entities, and intent.
Assigns a Category (e.g., Sales Inquiry, Accounting/Invoice, Customer Complaint, Contract Review).
Entity Extraction
Extracts specific data points from the content.
Extracts Key Data (e.g., Recipient Name, Customer ID, Policy Number, Invoice Amount, Sender Company Name).
AI Routing Logic
Uses the extracted category and entities to match the fax against staff/customer profiles.
Assigns a Staff/Case Owner, routing the document considering the staff member's current workload.
A.2 Hard Route Rules (IF/THEN Logic)
The system must allow administrators to define powerful non-AI routing criteria to enhance the rule set,:
Rule Type
Description
Area Code/Prefix
Route based on a geographic region or exchange (e.g., (212)xxx-xxxx to the New York Sales Team inbox).
DID Routing
Route based on the specific Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number the fax was received on (e.g., a specific Accounting DID).
CSID/CNID Match
Route based on the Caller Station ID (CSID) or Caller Name ID (CNID) string transmitted by the sender's machine.
Recipient Name/To Field
Route based on a specific name mentioned in the fax header's "To" field (e.g., "Attention: Dr. Jones").
Time of Day/Day of Week
Route faxes received outside standard business hours (e.g., 5 PM – 8 AM or weekends).
Page Count/Size
Route faxes based on length; faxes over 25 pages may be routed to a Cloud Archive first.
A.3 Advanced Routing Actions
Routing actions can involve complex integrations:
• Data Extraction & Webhook: Use OCR/AI to extract structured data (JSON/XML) and send it via a Webhook to a target system to trigger an RPA Bot (Robotic Process Automation) for data entry into CRM or ERP.
• Task Creation: Automatically create a ticket or task in a project management system (e.g., Jira, Asana) upon receipt of a certain fax category (e.g., Complaint creates a High-Priority ticket).
• Priority Tagging: Assign an urgency level that follows the document into its destination (e.g., tagging faxes with keywords like "STAT" or "Urgent" as Critical).
A.4 AI Success Metrics (Acceptance Criteria)
• AC-AI-01: The AI must achieve 90% accuracy in correctly classifying faxes into pre-defined categories after the initial training period.
• AC-AI-02: When routing to a specific employee, the AI must provide a confidence score (e.g., 95% certainty) and default to a Human Review Queue if the score is below a threshold (e.g., 70%).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Module B: Digital Document Annotation & Signature Toolkit
This module provides the features necessary to support the "Receive, Act, and Return" workflow.
B.1 Electronic Signature Functionality
• Signature Creation: Users must be able to create and save signatures using three methods: Typing (rendering name in a cursive font), Drawing (using a mouse, stylus, or finger), and Uploading (with a background cleanup tool).
• Placement & Editing: The signature must be movable, resizable, and rotatable using drag-and-drop functionality.
• Audit Trail Inclusion: Once applied, the system must digitally embed metadata (user ID, timestamp) into the document image adjacent to the signature.
B.2 Custom Stamping Feature
• SR-01 (Stamp Library): Users must be able to create a library of pre-designed stamps for one-click application, customizable by Text (e.g., PAID, CONFIDENTIAL), Date (automatic insertion), and Style (font, border shape, color, and transparency).
• SR-02 (Signature Combination): Ability to combine a user's signature with a dynamic stamp (e.g., placing the signature inside a custom "Approved by [User]" stamp border).
• SR-03 (Metadata Stamping): Ability to automatically pull and stamp fax metadata onto the document (e.g., placing a stamp that reads: "Received via Fax [Date] [Time]").
B.3 Return Workflow
After annotation, the user must have seamless options to handle the document:
• Return via Fax: A One-Click Send button must automatically initiate a new fax transmission using the Sender's original fax number as the recipient. The newly signed/stamped PDF replaces the original fax content.
• Return via Email: The system creates a new email, attaches the signed PDF, and uses the Sender's original email address as the recipient. The user must be given a text box to edit the email subject and body before sending.
• Internal Filing: A "Save Finalized Copy" button triggers the Rule-Based Routing logic (Module A) to file the document in the correct customer portal or cloud storage folder.
B.4 Annotation Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
• NF-TS-01 (Legal Binding): The service must confirm that the e-signature feature complies with relevant e-signature laws (e.g., UETA and ESIGN Act in the US).
• NF-TS-02 (Immutability): Once a signed or stamped document is saved, the system must not allow the user to undo or re-edit the applied annotations, requiring the creation of a new version to preserve the integrity of the original action.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Module C: Three-Tier Fax Validation System (Inbound Security)
This system provides a multi-layered defense against known threats, suspicious traffic, and unknown senders.
C.1 Tier 1: Hard Rules (Whitelist/Blacklist)
• Whitelist (FR-WL-01): Any fax from a whitelisted number must bypass AI classification and be routed directly to its final destination. The console must support wildcard entries and be manageable via an Admin Console.
• Blacklist (FR-BL-01): Any fax from an internally blacklisted number must be immediately rejected and deleted without processing or storage.
    ◦ DB Integration (FR-BL-02): The system must integrate via API with an external Spam/Fraud Database and update the Blacklist hourly.
    ◦ Customer Block (FR-BL-03): Individual users must be able to add a sender number to their Personal Blacklist.
C.2 Tier 2: AI Validation & Classification
If a sender number is not found on the Whitelist or Blacklist, it proceeds to AI validation.
• Spam/Legitimacy Confidence Score: The AI assigns a score based on:
    ◦ Content Analysis: Keywords (e.g., "discount," "loan offer") and lack of standard business entities.
    ◦ Metadata Check: Time of transmission (bulk faxes often arrive overnight) and source type.
    ◦ Prior History: Cross-reference against past, failed, or challenged transmissions in the system.
• Routing based on Score:
    ◦ 0% to 30% Spam Score: Route immediately via standard Rule-Based Routing.
    ◦ 31% to 80% Spam Score: Trigger the Questionnaire Challenge (Tier 3).
    ◦ 81% to 100% Spam Score: Treat as Blacklist; Reject and Delete the fax without notification to the sender.
C.3 Tier 3: Questionnaire Challenge (Sender Verification)
When the AI flags a fax as suspicious (31%-80% score):
• Action (FR-QC-01): The system must immediately execute a Fax-Back Challenge by sending an automated, single-page fax back to the sender’s number.
• Content (FR-QC-02): The fax must contain a brief Questionnaire (e.g., Company Name, Reason for Fax, Contact Email) and a unique, time-sensitive Validation Code.
• Success Condition: The system receives a fax back from the exact same sender number that includes the Validation Code and filled-out questionnaire fields. The sender is marked "Validated" and the original held fax is immediately released and delivered.
• Failure Condition: If the system does not receive a reply within the set time limit (e.g., 24 hours), the held fax is deleted.
C.4 Validation NFRs
• NF-VL-01 (Queue Management): The system must have a dedicated, visible "Held Faxes Queue" dashboard for administrators to manually review and release/delete faxes currently undergoing the Challenge process,.
• NF-VL-02 (Latency): The entire Tier 1 and Tier 2 AI classification process must be completed in under 5 seconds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Module D: Outgoing Fax Security and Anti-Spoofing
This module details defenses against malicious actors faking the Caller ID or gaining unauthorized access to customer accounts.
D.1 Sender Authentication Strategies
• Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Require users to provide two or more verification factors to access the account and the fax sending feature.
• Strict Originator Source Locking (Email-to-Fax): Allow fax sending only from the pre-registered, verified email addresses associated with that customer's account, rejecting requests from unverified email addresses.
• API Key and Digital Signature Verification (Programmatic Sending): Each API request must include a unique API Key or Bearer Token for authentication and ideally a digital signature (using cryptographic hashing) to prevent tampering.
• Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection: Set a maximum number of faxes that can be sent per hour from a single account, and flag suspicious activities like geographic anomalies (e.g., login from NY followed by transmission from a different continent).
D.2 Confirmation Loop for Email-to-Fax
This second layer of authentication prevents unauthorized transmission via the Email-to-Fax gateway,.
• Trigger: The loop must be triggered when any user attempts to send a fax via the Email-to-Fax method, unless the sending email address is already whitelisted (e.g., due to MFA enabled on their account).
• Workflow Steps:
    1. Hold Request: System receives the email-to-fax request and holds it.
    2. Generate Preview & Code: System generates a PDF preview of the fax and creates a unique, single-use, time-sensitive Confirmation Code (minimum 6-character alphanumeric code, valid for 10 minutes maximum),.
    3. Send Confirmation: Confirmation Message is sent to the customer’s pre-registered, trusted channel (Email or SMS).
    4. User Confirmation: User must confirm within the time limit by clicking a link in the email, replying to the email with the code, or replying to the SMS with the code.
    5. Final Transmission: If verified, the fax is immediately transmitted. If incorrect or expired, the system sends a failure notification.
• Confirmation NFRs:
    ◦ Time-to-Send (NF-CONF-01): The entire process must be completed in under 2 minutes upon successful confirmation.
    ◦ Audit Trail (NF-CONF-03): The system must log the entire confirmation process, including Initial Sender IP, Confirmation Code Sent Time, Confirmation Received Time, and Confirmation Channel Used (Email/SMS).
D.3 General Audit and Logging Requirements
• Immutable Logs: Maintain a detailed, non-editable audit trail of every fax send request, including the authenticated User ID, the source IP address, the exact time, and the delivery status,.
• Internal CSID: The system must inject an internal, verifiable identifier into the fax header that can only be generated by the platform.
