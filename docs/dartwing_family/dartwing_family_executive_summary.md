## Executive Summary

Dartwing Family transforms the same enterprise-grade, HIPAA-ready, Frappe + Keycloak platform that powers DartwingFax into the world’s most secure, beautiful, and useful family operating system.

A **Family** is a private, encrypted space where parents, kids, caregivers, and even co-owners of vacation homes live together digitally. Every feature is mobile-first, works fully offline, and feels as polished as Apple or Notion — yet runs on the exact same audited backend that already serves 12,000+ regulated businesses.

### Who This Is For

- Busy parents who want one place for everything they own and coordinate
- Multi-generational households and aging-in-place families
- Vacation home co-owners (friends or extended family)
- High-net-worth families who demand absolute privacy
- Landlords who want a consumer-friendly front-door to their eventual DartwingPro rental empire

### Privacy & Security – Same DNA as DartwingFax

- End-to-end encryption available (Enterprise families)
- COPPA-compliant child accounts (no email, no tracking)
- Same immutable audit trail used by hospitals and law firms
- Optional client-side keys — even we can’t read your data

> **Dartwing Family is the first consumer app that feels like Apple or Notion, runs like Fort Knox, and is built on the same platform that already powers mission-critical business workflows.**

We didn’t build a toy family app.  
We gave families the same superpowers we already give hospitals, law firms, and Fortune 1000 companies.
